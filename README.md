# Multi-threaded Server Project

This project aims to implement a multi-threaded server with meaningful requests handling, providing a foundation for handling high loads of complex or numerous requests. The server architecture is designed to efficiently distribute and execute tasks in parallel using a thread pool.

## Project Structure
- Create Folders: Organize our project into logical folders such as include for header files, src for source files, and logs for log files.
- CMakeLists.txt: Create a CMakeLists.txt file to configure project build. This file specifies the project name, source files, include directories, and any dependencies.

```


## Step 2: Header Files 
- Task.hpp: Define the base Task class with virtual methods to represent different types of tasks that the server can handle.
- TaskQueue.hpp: Define the TaskQueue class to manage a queue of tasks. Include necessary headers like <mutex> for thread safety.
- ThreadPool.hpp: Define the ThreadPool class to manage a pool of threads for executing tasks concurrently.
- Server.hpp: Define the Server class to encapsulate the server logic. Include necessary headers and forward declarations.

## Step 3: Source Files
- Task.cpp: Implement the methods of the Task class. These methods will vary based on the specific task types we want to implement.
- TaskQueue.cpp: Implement the methods of the TaskQueue class, such as push() and pop(), for managing the task queue safely.
- ThreadPool.cpp: Implement the methods of the ThreadPool class, such as the constructor, destructor, and workerThread(), for managing threads.
- Server.cpp: Implement the methods of the Server class, such as start(), stop(), and addTask(), for handling server operations.

## Step 4: Logging
- Initialize Logging: Use a logging library like ' spdlog ' to initialize logging in the Server class constructor. Configure loggers and log levels as needed.
- Log Messages: Use logger methods (info(), debug(), etc.) to log relevant messages throughout the server codebase, providing insights into server operations and errors.

## Step 5: Testing
- Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual components like TaskQueue and ThreadPool to ensure they function correctly.
- Integration Tests: Test the integration of components in the Server class to verify the server's overall functionality.
- Load Testing: Implement load testing to evaluate server performance under various levels of concurrent requests. Monitor metrics like response time and throughput.

## Step 6: Debugging and Error Handling
- Compile Errors: Address compilation errors by reviewing error messages, checking syntax, and ensuring proper header inclusions.
- Linker Errors: Resolve linker errors by verifying proper linking of source files and libraries, and ensuring all dependencies are included.
- Runtime Errors: Handle runtime errors such as segmentation faults or exceptions by debugging code, adding error checks, and improving error logging.
